    "* Prevalence & incidence: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    * In the US, there are 50,000 new diagnosed cases of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\n",
    "* Risk factors (genetic, lifestyle): https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/causes\n",
    "    *  Lung Fibrosis has an increased risk of devlopment as age increases. \n",
    "    *  Since the disease causes scar tissue on the lower lungs, it is based off of weakening of the repair process after excessive damage. Further risk factors that may cause excessive damage are smoking, specific genetics (either by mutation or family iniheritance), respiratory infections. \n",
    "    *  Based on previous studies, it is seen that men diagnosis is more common than female. \n",
    "* Symptoms: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448162/ and https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pulmonary-fibrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353690 \n",
    "    * Linked with common cough, fatigue, aching muscles (back) and shortness of breath\n",
    "    * Increased risk of other respiratory or musculoskeletal diseases. Exampeles being venous thromboembolism, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or osteoporosis.\n",

Specifically, the images portay a 2D cut out of the lungs at different depths (ranging from 15 to 10000 micrometers) to visualize tissue damage. Shown within these jpg.'s, the white pixelation represents either tissue damage or misreads of the circulation system within the lungs. By splitting each of these up and organizing them by their respective depths, the data analysis sets to match a percentage of all the white pixels to each image. "
